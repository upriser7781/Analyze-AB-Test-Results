## Analyze-AB-Test-Results


A/B tests are used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, while the experiment group sees the new version. A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other. A/B testing is very much like hypothesis testing with the following hypotheses:

- Null Hypothesis: The new version is no better, or even worse, than the old version
- Alternative Hypothesis: The new version is better than the old version
